sqlite

small. fast. reliable.

unlike client-server dbs, sqlite doesn't have a separate server process
embedded directly into the program (either statically or dynamically)

ACID-compliant

"an abstraction of fopen"
sqlite stores everything (tables, indices, triggers, views...) into a single disk file. 
widely used as an application file format.
